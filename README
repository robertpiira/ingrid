Hello, I'm Ingrid!

Ingrid is a fluid CSS layout system, who's main goal is to reduce the use of classes on individual units.

Ingrid is a bit less obtrusive and bit more fun to reflow for responsive layouts.

Ingrid is heavily inspired by oocss grids (oocss.org).

Ingrid is also meant to be an extendable system, easy to customize to your own needs.

Ingrid loves cats :o)

So, The basic idea…

+-------------------[c]-------------------+
¦ +-------+ +-------+ +-------+ +-------+ ¦
¦ |       | |       | |       | |       | ¦
¦ |  [u]  | |  [u]  | |  [u]  | |  [u]  | ¦
¦ |       | |       | |       | |       | ¦
¦ +-------+ +-------+ +-------+ +-------+ ¦
+-----------------------------------------+

The container [c] needs two class-names:

  1) .ingrid
  2) .in-fourths (or .in-thirds if there are 3 units).
  
Each unit [u] within the container [c] needs the class-name:

  1) .unit
  
___________________________________________


To tweak the layout we can combine units

+-------------------[c]-------------------+
¦ +-------+ +-------+ +-----------------+ ¦
¦ |       | |       | |                 | ¦
¦ |  [u]  | |  [u]  | |       [u]       | ¦
¦ |       | |       | |                 | ¦
¦ +-------+ +-------+ +-----------------+ ¦
+-----------------------------------------+

In this case the container [c] and units [u] have 
the same class-names as in the first example.

The difference is that we add the class-name .span-2 
on the last unit (making it span the width of 
two units).

The span-x class-name can be used to combine units 
in any context (in-twos / thirds / fourths etc).

___________________________________________


Units [f] that need to span the whole width of the
container use the class .field-unit.

+-------------------[c]-------------------+
¦ +-------------------------------------+ ¦
¦ |                 [f]                 | ¦
¦ +-------------------------------------+ ¦
¦ +-------+ +-------+ +-------+ +-------+ ¦
¦ |       | |       | |       | |       | ¦
¦ |  [u]  | |  [u]  | |  [u]  | |  [u]  | ¦
¦ |       | |       | |       | |       | ¦
¦ +-------+ +-------+ +-------+ +-------+ ¦
+-----------------------------------------+

Gutters

The gutters are made by first giving the container [c]
negative left and right margins. 

Each unit [u] has a padding on each side that is equal to
the containers [c] negative margins.

The gutters are set to a certain width in ingrid.css. 
But these measures can easily be overridden/tweaked to your 
own preference via your own classes that extend the container 
or directly in the ingrid css-file.

The paddings are/can be set directly on each unit thanks to 
the border-box box model. And last but not least, the widths for 
the paddings (again, thanks to border-box) work with em, % or 
pixel units.

Details

Ingrid uses display: inline-block and border-box box model
for laying out the individual units.

Border-box makes it easy to set borders and padding (for gutters)
directly on units. 

Inline-block is just nice to work with and easy to reflow 
for different layouts.

The one negative with inline-bock is the additional white-space 
that gets added between units. To remove the white-space evenly 
across different browsers can seem bit hacky. So Ingrid tries her 
best to get rid of the white-space. But the results are not 
cross-browser pixel-perfect. But—really—Ingrid just doesn't care 
about pixel-perfection in that sense anymore.

Some nicer details with Ingrid is that we don't need to add 
class-names like .first / .last / grid-6 / size1of5 etc. 
on each unit.


You could also skip the whole in-fourths / in-fifths class-names 
that Ingrid provides and make your own semantic class names 
for width hooks instead. 

The container doesn't neither have to be called ".ingrid", change
all these class-names to anything semantic or unsemantic you like!

Compability 

Ingrid works just fine with IE8 + and all modern browsers.
IE6-7 might need some extra help for not supporting border-box model.
